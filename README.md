Meeting repo with tutorial materials and playgrounds

##What you need to know
You will need to clone this repo and "Hacking with Swift's" repo. This is because each repo serves a different purpose. Our repo is for playgrounds and in-depth discussion in language conventions while "Hacking with Swift" is dedicated to the core project files for each week's project.
